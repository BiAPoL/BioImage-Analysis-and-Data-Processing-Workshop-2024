# Introduction to Bio-Image Analysis with Jupyter and napari

In this lecture, we will explore, using jupyter notebooks, how to open images using Python and visualizing them in [napari](https://napari.org/stable/). We will also apply some filters and perform a standard segmentation workflow. This workflow will be then applied to images in a folder, illustrating how we could do batch processing.

Finally we explore the [napari-assistant plugin](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-assistant) to interactively run image processing in napari and export a workflow as a jupyter notebook.
