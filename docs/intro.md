# Bio-Image Analysis with napari plugins

In this workshop, we will explore ways to analyze and visualize microscopy images with [napari](https://napari.org/stable/), an nD viewer open-source software.

We explore some napari plugins as an interactive and convenient way of performing these analysis, especially the [napari-assistant](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-assistant?tab=readme-ov-file#napari-assistant), [napari-apoc](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-accelerated-pixel-and-object-classification?tab=readme-ov-file#napari-accelerated-pixel-and-object-classification-apoc) and [napari-flim-phasor-plotter](https://github.com/zoccoler/napari-flim-phasor-plotter?tab=readme-ov-file#napari-flim-phasor-plotter) plugins.

Some [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks will be used to illustrate and reproduce the examples.
