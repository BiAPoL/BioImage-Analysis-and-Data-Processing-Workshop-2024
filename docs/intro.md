# QM Course - Lectures on Bio-Image Analysis with napari

In these lectures, we will explore ways to analyze microscopy images with Python and visualize them with [napari](https://napari.org/stable/), an nD viewer open-source software.
The analysis will be done in Python mostly using the [scikit-image](https://scikit-image.org/), [pyclesperanto](https://github.com/clEsperanto/pyclesperanto_prototype?tab=readme-ov-file#py-clesperanto) and [apoc](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/apoc?tab=readme-ov-file#accelerated-pixel-and-object-classification-apoc) libraries, via [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks.
We will also explore some napari plugins as an interactive and convenient alternative way of performing these analysis, especially the [napari-assistant](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-assistant?tab=readme-ov-file#napari-assistant), [napari-apoc](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-accelerated-pixel-and-object-classification?tab=readme-ov-file#napari-accelerated-pixel-and-object-classification-apoc) and [napari-flim-phasor-plotter](https://github.com/zoccoler/napari-flim-phasor-plotter?tab=readme-ov-file#napari-flim-phasor-plotter) plugins.
